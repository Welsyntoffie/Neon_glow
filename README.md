# Manual installation
Create a directory in your themes folder and name it blue_neon_edge
Copy the contents of this repo's themes folder to your home assistants themes folder you just created.
Restart Home Assistant or call Home Assistant Frontend: Reload themes from the dev section

# Add theme repository to HACS
If there is a theme that you would like to download, but it’s not available via HACS, you can add the theme’s repository to HACS and easily download it to your Home Assistant.

To do this, copy the URL of the theme’s GitHub repository. Then, in HACS, go to Frontend. Click on the icon with the 3 dots at the top right and click on Custom repositories. Paste the URL for the theme under, Repository. Then under Category, select theme. Click on Add, and the theme will now show as a new repository. Open it and click on Download this repository with HACS. Leave it set to the latest version and then click on Download again. That’s it; if you go to the Profile tab, you can see the new theme added in the Theme’s dropdown.
